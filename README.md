# solitaire-the-idiot

A solitaire (patience) game that solves itself. 

This is one of the first JAVA programs i wrote. Probably back in 1999.
I used to do this solitaire as a kid. It was called The Idiot (Idioten in Swedish). But looking it up now I realised that it is actually called The long yournet (Den l√•nga resan in Swedish). https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den_l%C3%A5nga_resan_(patiens). 

Compile it:

    javac src/norman/cards/*.java

Run it:

    cd src/norman
    java -cp .. norman.cards.TheIdiot
